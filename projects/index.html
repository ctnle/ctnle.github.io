        Introduction
    </h2>
    <p>
        In 2020, the American Glaucoma Society released a paper reviewing and highlighting the 100 most impactful manuscripts in glaucoma based on a survey of their membership.
        These works span over half a century of research efforts that define the current practice landscape. My goal is to gradually and intentionally review these AGS 100 manuscripts, 
        pouring over their individual threads with a magnifying glass, observing the weaving of the fibers, stepping back to see their place in the tapestry - before diving back in again.

        There will be no structure to this, I'm just learning as I go.
